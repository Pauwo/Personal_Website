    <h1>A Paragraph About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Paulo Hernandez and I was born in the Philippines. I moved to Canada when I was almost 11 years old.</p>
    <p>I <em><strong>love</strong></em> travelling. I have been to many different countries before and it's definitely my <em>favourite</em> hobby. It is just so fun.</p>
    <p>I would love to travel more in the future, but it is so <strong>expensive.</strong> While I'm not travelling, I also like doing my other hobbies.</p>
    <p>My other hobbies include watching tv shows/movies, playing sports/video games, going to the gym, and listening to music.</p>
    <p>I wish I could do my hobbies more, but I am just so <em><strong>busy</strong></em> these days. The courses that I'm taking in school take so much of my time.</p>
    <br>

    <h3>3 Courses that I'm taking:</h3>
