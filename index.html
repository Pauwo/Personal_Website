      <header><h1>About Me</h1></header>
      <p>
        My name is Paulo Hernandez and I was born in the Philippines. I moved to
        Canada when I was almost 11 years old.
      </p>
      <p>
        I <em><strong>love</strong></em> travelling. I have been to many
        different countries before and it's definitely my
        <em>favourite</em> hobby. It is just so fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would love to travel more in the future, but it is so
        <strong>expensive.</strong> While I'm not travelling, I also like doing
        my other hobbies.
      </p>
      <p>
        My other hobbies include watching tv shows/movies, playing sports/video
        games, going to the gym, and listening to music.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wish I could do my hobbies more, but I am just so
        <em><strong>busy</strong></em> these days. The courses that I'm taking
        in school take so much of my time.
