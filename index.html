        <p>
          My name is Paulo Hernandez and I was born in the Philippines. I moved
          to Canada when I was almost 11 years old. I
          <em><strong>love</strong></em> travelling. I have been to many
          different countries before and it's definitely my
          <em>favourite</em> hobby. It is just so fun. I would love to travel
          more in the future, but it is so <strong>expensive.</strong> While I'm
          not travelling, I also like doing my other hobbies.
        </p>

        />
        <p>
          My other hobbies include watching tv shows/movies, playing
          sports/video games, going to the gym, and listening to music. I wish I
          could do my hobbies more, but I am just so
          <em><strong>busy</strong></em> these days. The courses that I'm taking
          in school take so much of my time.
